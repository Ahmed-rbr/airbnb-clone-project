# Airbnb Clone Project

## 🌍 Project Overview

**Airbnb Clone Project** is a  accommodation booking platform inspired by Airbnb, developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program (ProDev Front-End & Back-End tracks). This project simulates a real-world team-based development environment, with a focus on scalable architecture, clean UI/UX, API design, and deployment.

Users can browse property listings, view details, filter search results, and book stays. The application combines a modular React frontend with a robust backend API and integrates Docker-based deployments and CI/CD pipelines.
